    <h2> My hobbies 👦 </h2>
      <p class= "boxes-of- categories"> I love sharing moments with my friends 🤜🤛 such as going to the cinema 🎦 or to the restaurant 🍽. For me, friends represent a shoulder than we can lean on, a help that you can give or receive, at any moment of your life. <br> <br>

      I also love running and cycling 🎽🚴‍, because that allows me to go beyond myself and be proud of what I accomplish.</p>
